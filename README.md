# COMP-3008 Object-Oriented System Design - Course Repository

## Course Description
This course is a continuation of Object-Oriented Systems Analysis, focusing on design-level UML modeling, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, and project management of design alternatives. The course emphasizes iterative and incremental development methodologies, with a special focus on the Unified Process (UP). By combining the knowledge from OO Systems Analysis and this course, students will gain proficiency in:

- **Object-Oriented Modeling**: From analysis to design, including user experience, database persistence, code implementation, and software deployment.
- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**: Visual modeling to capture software structure and behavior.
- **CASE Tools**: Commercial-grade tools for modeling and design.
- **Industry-Standard Software Development Processes**: Emphasizing best practices and modern techniques.
- **Project Management Techniques**: Practical methods for managing a project through multiple iterations.

The course consists of learning modules containing content, additional resources, and assessments. Students are encouraged to complete the module content and assessments and review supplementary resources to enhance their understanding and success in the assessments.
