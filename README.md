# -COMP-3008-OO-System-Design

Course Introduction

This course is a continuation of Object-Oriented Systems Analysis with an emphasis on design-level UML modelling, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool instruction, and project management of design alternatives. Iterative and incremental development methodologies are a focus, with particular emphasis on the Unified Process (UP). The combination of OO Systems Analysis and this course will equip you with a good working knowledge of: (i) object-oriented modelling from analysis to design, including user experience, database persistence, code implementation, and software deployment; (ii) visual modelling with UML; (iii) commercial-grade CASE tools; (iv) industry standard software development processes; and (v) practical techniques for managing a project through multiple iterations.

Course format

This course consists of learning modules comprised of module content, additional resources, and assessments. You must complete the module content and assessments within each module. It is highly recommended to study the additional resources since they are included to enhance understanding and provide assistance with the assessments.
