# COMP-3008 OO System Design Repository

## Course Description

This course is a continuation of Object-Oriented Systems Analysis with an emphasis on design-level UML modelling, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool instruction, and project management of design alternatives. Iterative and incremental development methodologies are a focus, with particular emphasis on the Unified Process (UP). The combination of OO Systems Analysis and this course will equip you with a good working knowledge of: (i) object-oriented modelling from analysis to design, including user experience, database persistence, code implementation, and software deployment; (ii) visual modelling with UML; (iii) commercial-grade CASE tools; (iv) industry standard software development processes; and (v) practical techniques for managing a project through multiple iterations.
